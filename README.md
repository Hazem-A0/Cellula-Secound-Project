# Fare Amount Prediction Model
# Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate fare amounts using a dataset with various features. The goal is to create an accurate model that can predict fare amounts based on input features.

Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The initial phase involved cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring that the data was suitable for analysis. We then performed feature engineering, including one-hot encoding, to convert categorical variables into a machine-readable format.

2. Data Visualization
To gain deeper insights into the dataset, we visualized key features and their relationships with the target variable. This step helped us identify patterns and potential areas of improvement in the dataset.

3. Feature Selection
We employed feature selection techniques to identify the most important features influencing fare amounts. By narrowing down the feature set, we aimed to enhance model performance and reduce computational complexity.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using methods like GridSearchCV and Optuna. This step was crucial in fine-tuning the model's parameters to achieve the best possible accuracy.

5. Model Training
After preprocessing and feature selection, we trained several machine learning models to predict fare amounts. The model's performance was evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

6. Evaluation and Deployment
The final model was thoroughly evaluated and deployed, ready to be used in predicting fare amounts based on new data.

# Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning in building an effective fare prediction model. The final model demonstrates robust performance and can be utilized in real-world applications.
